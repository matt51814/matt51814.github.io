Another year, another Advent of Code... 

This year they have reduced the number of days to complete from 25 to 12. This may actually give me enough time to complete it all before I spend my days too lathargic to do anything.

I will write my solutions in Python and share them on here. These won't be especially optimised, as long as they are able to crack the solution I'm happy.

If you haven't heard of Advent of Code, I do encourage you to take a look [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

I am writing this on the 14th and the 12 days of challenges are all currently out, so I will not be releasing my solutions on the corresponding day. Maybe if I was a bit more organised that would have worked well.

### Merry Christmas 🎅🏼
