I want to outline what I want to achieve with this site. In case someone finds it and thinks "why is this guy writing into the void?" Do not worry, I'm not completely mad. I am using it for the following reasons:

1. I want a online accessible store for self produced items related to technology which will help me in both personal and professional settings.
2. I want to be able to easily share information on what I'm currently working on.
3. I want to force myself to write coherently. Maybe one day I will write about random topics that I find interesting rather than keeping it purely focused on technology. Chances are I will get bored and stop very shortly.
